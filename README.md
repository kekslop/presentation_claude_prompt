## About This Project

These slides were created using Claude-3.7-sonnet with a specialized system prompt that ensures:

- Consistent styling across all slides
- Responsive layout with appropriate spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy and information organization
- Horizontal presentation format

The system includes baseline examples and considerations for the initial phase of digital transformation. The prompt maintains style consistency while allowing for flexibility in content generation.
